# Shared agent definitions

`definitions/` is the source of truth for custom agent roles. Its Markdown
files use Claude Code-compatible agent frontmatter as a practical superset;
the prompt body and canonical lowercase role name are shared by both tools.
Keep prompt wording provider-neutral; tool-specific settings belong in
frontmatter adapter fields.

`skills/` is the source and template tree for shared skills. Markdown files may
include another skills-root-relative Markdown file with a marker on its own
line:

```md
<!-- @include shared/decision-discipline.md -->
```

The build expands includes recursively into complete standalone skill files.
Missing targets, escaping paths, cycles, frontmatter markers, and malformed or
unresolved markers fail validation.

Nix generates the Claude Code and Codex representations into the store, and
Home Manager links them at activation. It also renders the shared skill tree
into the store; generated files do not live in Git. Skill changes therefore
require `darwin-rebuild switch` before they become active.

To inspect generated output manually:

```sh
output_dir=$(mktemp -d)
python3 home/patrick/agents/bin/generate-agent-configs.py \
  --target codex \
  --output "$output_dir"

python3 home/patrick/agents/bin/expand-skills.py \
  --source home/patrick/agents/skills \
  --output "$output_dir/skills"
```

To validate skills, generated formats, policies, hooks, and the handover
fingerprint, use Python with PyYAML (the Nix build provides it):

```sh
python3 home/patrick/agents/bin/test-agent-configs.py \
  home/patrick/agents
```

The generator translates portable fields to both formats. Each definition
declares its Codex model and sandbox; Claude-specific models, tools, and hooks
remain optional adapter fields. New roles therefore cannot accidentally
inherit write access or an unintended Codex model.

Each role's `codex-model` field owns its model selection; validation requires
an explicit, nonempty model without pinning a particular selection.

Scout and explore return discovery results in their responses. Other specialists
can write assigned artifacts directly. Native configurations provide file-write
tools and workspace access; role instructions confine edits
to assigned artifacts, with implementation changes reserved for implementation
roles. The shell guard remains in place for investigation commands.

Handover uses `python3 "$HOME/.agents/bin/worktree-fingerprint" <repo>` to
capture Git-visible state. The helper includes staged entries, working files,
and nonignored untracked contents without changing Git state.

The `architect` skill coordinates the architecture specialist without requiring
supervisor. The agent owns design and review; `second-opinion` independently
challenges decisions. The lead selects each for a concrete question. `plan`
decomposes an agreed design or established pattern into implementation work.

Tool-specific names are optional and default to the canonical `name`. Shared
`explore` overrides that default as Claude Code's `Explore` and Codex's
`explorer`; shared `plan` becomes Claude Code's `Plan` and remains lowercase
in Codex.
